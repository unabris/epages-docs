# Motivation
> A Brown Bag Session is a training or learning session during an extended lunch break.

We want to stay smart and informed about the modern technology landscape
and accumulate a toolbox of useful _Techniques_, _Tools_, _Platforms_, _Languages & Frameworks_
in the spirit of the ThoughtWorks [Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar).

------------------

# CoP Comparison

## Community of Practice

- bi-weekly schedule
- sharing knowledge of actual BEYOND findings
- directly applicable to our daily business

## Brown Bag Session

- monthly schedule
- topics not necessarily related to current BEYOND tech
- findings could lead to negative assessment (_hold_)


------------------

# Format

- Meet once per month, Friday 12:00 - 14:00
- Topic defined by agenda upfront
- conference room with projector
- Limited number of voluntary participants
- [Mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming)
  * or parallel pair programming exercises
- Bring Your Own Lunch
  * or order pizza

------------------

# Outcome

- knowledge gained by all participants
- technology assessment (e.g. _adopt_, _trial_, _assess_, _hold_)
- documented learnings (e.g. Confluence)
- boosted communication channels
- team building effects
- employee motivation ;-)

------------------
